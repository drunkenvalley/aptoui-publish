# apto-hud

This is intended to be a replacement for the player frame and target frame
based on a WeakAura setup that I previously had.

The setup is for a hud surrounding the character, where:

- the bottom-left third is the player health
- the bottom-right third is the main player resource (mana, energy, rage, runic power, etc)
- additional resources show as a set of icons inside the bottom-right third (combo points, etc)

## Blizzard documentation

The documentation provided by Blizzard is generally not very good. There is a github repo
with some information provided:

## Community documentation

There are a wide range of websites which provide tutorials and other help. A particularly helpful
guide is below:

## Use of AI

I used Copilot to help me build this. There is not a lot of code that has been written by Copilot
and I would urge caution for anyone else using Copilot or other AI tools due to the wealth
of addons and documentation of the pre-Midnight system that fundamentally doesn't work
any longer due to the changes to the addon ecosystem and the implementation of secret values
for many items.
