# apto-hud

This is intended to be a replacement for the player frame and target frame
based on a WeakAura setup that I previously had.

The setup is for a hud surrounding the character, where:

- the bottom-left third is the player health
- the bottom-right third is the main player resource (mana, energy, rage, runic power, etc)
- additional resources show as a second level inside the bottom-right third (runes, combo points, etc)
- the top third is the target health (optional)

## Blizzard documentation

The documentation provided by Blizzard is generally not very good. There is a github repo
with some information provided:

## Community documentation

There are a wide range of websites which provide tutorials and other help. A particularly helpful
guide is below:
